# convert-mc-to-ssc

Requirements: [Python simfile library](https://pypi.org/project/simfile/)

This is a farily specialized script to convert a Malody .mc chart to Stepmania .ssc format. This script **only** converts the chart, and takes as input a skeleton .ssc file with the song info already filled in.

The comments in the code are hopefully sufficient to explain more how it works and what it's doing.
I haven't tested doubles or multiple charts, but hopefully this can be easily adapted as needed.
